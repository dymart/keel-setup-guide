# spinnaker-config

This is a template repo intended for use with Spinnaker's
[base Kustomization](https://github.com/spinnaker/kustomization-base). Please
see the
[RFC](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/rfc/halyard-lite.md)
for an overview of the new Kubernetes-native installation pathway that is under
development.

This repo is under active development and is not ready for production (or even
development) use, but stay tuned for updates!
